# ML-Agents Reinforcement Learning

Welcome to the ML-Agents Reinforcement Learning project! This project utilizes Unity's ML-Agents toolkit in conjunction with OpenAI's Gym to explore reinforcement learning algorithms in a simulated environment.

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources to set up an environment where reinforcement learning agents can be trained using Unity's ML-Agents framework and interface with OpenAI's Gym toolkit. The goal is to create and train intelligent agents capable of learning and performing tasks within a controlled environment.

## Features

- Integration of Unity's ML-Agents and OpenAI's Gym for reinforcement learning experiments.
- Customizable environments and scenarios for training agents.
- Support for various reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Visualization tools to track agent performance and learning progress.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Unity 
- Python
- ML-Agents 
- OpenAI Gym 

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/ml-agents-reinforcement-learning.git
    ```

2. Install Unity and necessary packages following the instructions provided by Unity and ML-Agents documentation.
3. Install Python and required dependencies using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install gym
    # Other required packages
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Unity project in the Unity Editor.
2. Set up the environment, agents, and tasks within Unity's ML-Agents framework.
3. Run the Python scripts to interface with the Unity environment through OpenAI's Gym interface and start the training process:

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

4. Monitor the training progress and visualize agent performance using the provided tools.
